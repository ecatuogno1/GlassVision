# GlassVision Product Blueprint

## Vision Statement
GlassVision is a computer-vision powered application designed for soft-glass bead makers, borosilicate (boro) flame workers, and their suppliers. The platform identifies the color characteristics of art-glass rods, canes, frit, and finished pieces from images or live video streams. It empowers artists to catalogue their palettes, compare stock from vendors such as Mountain Glass, and contribute imagery that continuously improves the shared color identifier.

## Target Users and Use Cases
- **Soft-glass lampworkers (COE 104)**: Track glass rod inventories, match historical colors, and document kiln results.
- **Borosilicate artists (COE 33)**: Compare color shifts after flame or kiln striking and share test-tile photos.
- **Supply partners (e.g., Mountain Glass, ABR Imagery)**: Publish official color reference sets, notify customers of stock changes, and analyze customer sample submissions.
- **Community moderators and educators**: Curate shared libraries, validate submissions, and develop training content on lighting and photo capture best practices.

## Core Value Proposition
GlassVision minimizes guesswork when identifying art-glass colors and accelerates collaboration between artists and suppliers by offering:
- Automated color detection with standardized color space outputs (RGB, LAB) and artisan-friendly references (C.O.E., striking behavior, compatibility notes).
- Artist workbench tools for tagging annealing schedules, flame atmospheres, and kiln logs alongside uploaded photos.
- Vendor catalog integration that links official product photos, batch notes, and stock status to artist collections.
- Community training data pipelines that use artist uploads to continually refine the identifier model.

## Product Scope
1. **Acquisition Layer**
   - Upload still images (PNG, JPEG, TIFF) via web UI, mobile app, or vendor API.
   - Capture live frames from bench-mounted cameras for flame demonstrations.
   - Collect metadata about vendor, C.O.E., annealing cycles, and lighting setup alongside imagery.
2. **Processing Layer**
   - Preprocess images (cropping, white balance normalization, glare reduction) with presets tuned for soft-glass and boro lighting conditions.
   - Detect glass rods, beads, or components using segmentation models trained on community submissions.
   - Extract dominant color profiles, evaluate strike/oxidation shifts, and compare against vendor catalog references.
3. **Analytics & Reporting**
   - Provide studio dashboards for inventory color gaps, kiln test histories, and vendor substitution suggestions.
   - Offer supplier analytics on community demand, reported batch variances, and trending colors.
   - Exportable reports (PDF, CSV, JSON) with artist-ready summaries and supplier insights.
4. **Integration & Extensibility**
   - REST/GraphQL API endpoints for e-commerce platforms and point-of-sale systems.
   - Webhooks and SDKs to sync vendor inventory, announce new color batches, or trigger community challenges.
   - Plug-in architecture for specialty processes (e.g., UV-reactive verification, silver-striking guidance).

## Functional Requirements
1. **User & Community Management**
   - Role-based access (Artist, Studio Admin, Supplier, Moderator).
   - Authentication via email/password with MFA and optional social login for community participation.
   - Profile fields for skill level, preferred C.O.E., and studio affiliation.
2. **Collection & Batch Management**
   - Organize uploads into collections (rods, frit, finished work) with metadata for vendor, batch code, annealing schedule, and flame conditions.
   - Versioning for reprocessed items (e.g., re-struck pieces) with change history and commentary.
3. **Image Processing Pipeline**
   - Configurable preprocessing templates for soft-glass vs. boro lighting setups.
   - Support for GPU acceleration where available.
   - Near real-time guidance during live camera sessions (<2 seconds) for flame demos.
4. **Color & Behavior Analysis**
   - Extract dominant colors and compute delta-E comparisons against vendor references and community baselines.
   - Estimate color shifts after striking/oxidation and recommend kiln adjustments.
   - Provide multi-format outputs including HEX, RGB, LAB, and vendor catalog descriptors.
5. **Reporting, Discovery & Notifications**
   - Interactive dashboards with filters by vendor, C.O.E., kiln schedule, and torch settings.
   - Personalized alerts when vendors restock matching colors or community submissions confirm similar hues.
   - Event-driven notifications to prompt moderation review of new community uploads.
6. **Audit, Attribution & Licensing**
   - Track contributor credits for training data usage and enforce content licensing preferences.
   - Maintain immutable logs for supplier-provided references and community moderation actions.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Process 50 artist-uploaded photos (<15 MB each) or 10 vendor sample videos within 3 minutes using scalable worker nodes.
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling for processing services, community submissions, and vendor catalogs.
- **Reliability**: 99.5% uptime SLA for hosted solution with offline-first sync for mobile capture apps.
- **Security**: Encrypt data at rest and in transit, respect contributor licensing, and comply with privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA).
- **Maintainability**: Modular architecture with automated testing, CI/CD pipelines, and model retraining workflows.
- **Usability**: Accessible interfaces (WCAG 2.1 AA) optimized for torch-side tablet use and dark-room viewing.

## System Architecture Overview
1. **Frontend**: React/Next.js web application and companion mobile capture app for artist workflows, vendor dashboards, and moderation tooling.
2. **Backend API**: Node.js/TypeScript or Python FastAPI service orchestrating authentication, collection management, vendor catalog sync, and community moderation.
3. **Image & Model Services**: Python-based microservices leveraging OpenCV and deep learning models (e.g., U-Net for segmentation, contrastive learning for color matching) running on GPU-enabled infrastructure.
4. **Message Broker**: RabbitMQ or Kafka for coordinating uploads, training data pipelines, and notification fan-out.
5. **Storage**:
   - Object storage (S3-compatible) for raw photos, derived assets, and model checkpoints.
   - Relational database (PostgreSQL) for metadata, catalog data, community contributions, and audit logs.
   - Vector database (e.g., Pinecone, pgvector) for similarity search across color embeddings.
   - Analytics warehouse (BigQuery/Snowflake) for vendor and community insights.
6. **CI/CD & MLOps**: GitHub Actions or GitLab CI for automated testing, containerization, deployments, and scheduled model retraining.

## Deployment Topology
- **Cloud Deployment**: Kubernetes cluster (EKS/GKE/AKS) with auto-scaling GPU nodes, managed databases, and CDN-backed asset delivery.
